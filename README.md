Dan's configs and stuff

## bashrc
`~/.bashrc`

## init.vim
`~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

## tmux
`~/.tmux.conf`

note: tmux loads `~/.bash_profile` (and other stuff) but not `~/.bashrc`
had to `cp .bashrc .bash_profile`

## notes

### tools i cant use because... 
im too lazy to build nvim 0.7> and ubuntu repos currently have at most v0.6
